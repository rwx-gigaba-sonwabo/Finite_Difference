It was identified that within the current implementation, expected future dividends are discounted from their ex-dividend dates rather than their payment dates when determining the present value of dividends. From a theoretical and market-practice standpoint, this treatment introduces a temporal misalignment between the date on which the dividend is declared (ex-div date) and the date on which it is actually received (payment date).

Under standard market conventions, dividend cash flows are typically discounted from the dividend payment date, as this reflects the actual timing of the cash receipt and aligns the valuation with the corresponding discount factors applicable to that settlement date. Discounting from the ex-dividend date, by contrast, effectively brings forward the cash flow and applies an earlier discount factor, which may lead to slight overvaluation or undervaluation depending on the prevailing term structure of interest rates and timing differences between ex-div and payment dates.

To assess the quantitative impact of this discrepancy, Trade Number 176226492 was selected as a representative test case. The validation compared valuations and sensitivities derived under both treatments — discounting from ex-dividend dates versus discounting from payment dates — to evaluate the magnitude of the deviation. The analysis revealed that all differences across spot valuations and sensitivities were below the 1% materiality threshold defined for this validation exercise.

Accordingly, while the current treatment of discounting dividends from the ex-dividend date is not fully aligned with best-practice market standards, its quantitative impact on the valuation of the Theoretical Simple Dividend Option (TSDO) is immaterial within acceptable tolerance levels. Nonetheless, it is recommended that future enhancements to the model align the discounting convention with industry norms to ensure methodological consistency across instruments and improved transparency in dividend treatment.
